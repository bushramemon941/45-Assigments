// Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

let names:string[]= ['hafsa','sidra','pireh']
let message:string = 'Ramzan Mubarak  INSHA ALLAH we will meet soon'
 console.log(names[0] +" "+ message)
 console.log(names[1] +" "+ message)
 console.log(names[2] +" "+ message)
